## Using GitHub Discussions

We encourage all contributors to use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/accordproject/web-components/discussions) as the primary platform for:

- **Asking questions**: If you're unsure about how to contribute, need clarification on an issue, or have general questions, start a discussion.
- **Sharing ideas**: Propose new ideas, improvements, or feature requests in the Discussions section.
- **Getting help**: If you're stuck or need guidance, the community and maintainers are here to assist you.

### Why Use GitHub Discussions?
- **Keeps issues focused**: By using Discussions for questions and ideas, we can keep the Issues section dedicated to bugs and actionable tasks.
- **Encourages collaboration**: Discussions are a great place to brainstorm, share knowledge, and engage with the community.
- **Improves onboarding**: New contributors can easily find answers to common questions and get involved in the project.

### How to Get Started
1. Go to the [Discussions tab](https://github.com/accordproject/web-components/discussions).
2. Search for existing discussions to see if your question has already been answered.
3. If not, start a new discussion with a clear and descriptive title.
